## OpenQuake Engine for RHEL/CentOS 5 and 6

This project has been discontinued. Please consider upgrading to RHEL/CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 14.04 which are fully supported by the official OpenQuake release cycle and deeply tested. If you are running RHEL/CentOS 6 please also consider using an LXC container (see https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/master/doc/engine/Deploy-the-OpenQuake-Engine-using-LXC.md)
